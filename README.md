## 📝 Project Description
This project involved creating a **clean, modern landing page** based on a Figma design for both **English and Arabic** audiences.

I built the layout using **Gutenberg blocks** on the **Astra** theme and implemented custom styling, animations, and layout refinements.  
Multilingual support was configured with **Polylang**, including RTL-compatible adjustments for the Arabic version.

Additional tasks included:
- Polylang configuration for EN/AR pages  
- Contact Form 7 email setup  
- security plugin configuration  
- domain transfer assistance (registrar → new provider)  
- full migration of the website to a new hosting environment  
- testing after migration to ensure stable performance

The result is a lightweight, fast, responsive landing page ready for production use.
